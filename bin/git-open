# This script will open all files from a git diff or a git show in vim.

# Usage:
#   gitopen -- opens all added files that have changed since HEAD
#   gitopen diff HEAD -- these are the default parameters
#   gitopen diff master -- opens files that have changed from master
#   gitopen show -- opens files that were changed in the last revision (HEAD)
#   gitopen show HEAD -- default param, does the same
#   gitopen show 4b3ca34 -- opens a particular REV

# It's set to use macvim as the default editor, you can change that easily by
# changing this line:

COMMAND=diff
REV=HEAD

if [ $1 ]; then
    COMMAND=$1
fi

if [ $2 ]; then
    REV=$2
fi

if [ $COMMAND = "show" ]; then
    PARAM='--pretty=format: --name-only'
else
    PARAM='--name-only'
fi

git $COMMAND $PARAM $REV | xargs `git config --get core.editor`
